# Benford-s-Law-
This is a project designed to detect fraud in a data set through the application of Benford's Law (with csv files).

# Author: Tyler Windemuth

# How to use: 
Use a compiler with the python file and run a csv file with data through it. The program will then print
outputs to the console. This will consist of two parts: 
1. a bar chart that contains the percentages of appearances of certain values; and
2.  a statement that tells the user if the data set follows Benford's law.

# Note: 
Benford's Law only checks the leading significant digit.
